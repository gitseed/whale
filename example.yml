      # "run" is an example of a build action. Each build step can only have one action.
      # Specifying more than one action in a single step will result in a build error.
      # Different actions take different inputs. Run CAN take a simple string.

      # The root directory to copy from is actually the "files/" directory similar to ansible.
      # If this step is implemented inside a role, it will be the "files/" directory inside that role.
